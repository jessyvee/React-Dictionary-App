## React Dictionary App
This is a simple React dictionary app that allows you to search for the definitions of English words using the Free Dictionary API. This app was created using React and makes use of the useState and useRef hooks for managing state and updating the UI.
## Getting Started
To get started with the React Dictionary App, you can either clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.
Once you have the source code on your machine, open a terminal window in the root directory of the project and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

npm install

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

npm start

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. You can now search for English words and get their definitions.

## How to Use
To search for the definition of a word, simply type the word in the search box and press the Enter key or click on the "Search" button. The app will make a request to the Free Dictionary API and display the definition of the word on the screen. You can search for as many words as you want.

## Limitations
This app is limited to searching for English words only, and it may not return accurate or complete definitions for some complex or technical terms. The Free Dictionary API used by this app has usage limits, so you may encounter rate limiting or request failures if you make too many requests in a short period of time.
